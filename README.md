# Simple Brainf*ck interpreter
A simple interpreter for the esoteric language [Brainf*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

## How to use?
If you want to use the program anywhere on your pc, add it to your PATH (Please inform yourself on how to do that on your OS).
Then, you can execute `bf <filename> [anything to trigger debug mode]` in your favourite terminal :)
NOTE: When using PowerShell, make sure to either provide an absolute path (like "C:/MyStuff/file.txt") or prefix the filename by ".\"

## TODO
- Make the program support using " to make paths with spaces in them work
- ~~Add comments?~~ <- won't do
